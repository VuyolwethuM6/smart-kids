## Shattering the Glass Ceiling: A New Era of Inclusion

International Women's Day is more than a celebration—it's a powerful testament to resilience, innovation, and the unstoppable spirit of women in STEM fields. At Maths Science Innovation (MSI), we're not just acknowledging progress; we're actively creating pathways that dismantle historical barriers.

### The Current Landscape

Despite significant advances, women remain dramatically underrepresented in STEM:

- **Only 28%** of researchers worldwide are women
- **Less than 30%** of researchers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are female
- **Persistent gender pay gaps** in technical professions

### Our Comprehensive Approach to Empowerment

#### 1. Targeted Mentorship Programs

We connect aspiring female scientists with successful professionals through:

- One-on-one mentorship
- Career development workshops
- Networking opportunities
- Confidence-building seminars
